# transform [alpha, WIP]

> Transform (selected) text in atom editor.

A collection of usefull text transformations.

The inspiration for this package comes comes from several TextMate
packages. The small helpers like `HTML > URI-Encode` are the only
thing I really miss, however I think these "transformations" of the
current selection are better bundled together. For example, one
might need to URI-encode a small snippet of text outside of a
`.html` file.


## Features

- adds commands to apply [transformations][#transformations] to the selected text
- works with multiple selections (like the built-in `Edit > Text` Commands)


## Included Transformations

The following string methods from [`underscore.string`](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string)
are included as commands:

- **clean**: (no more than 1 whitespace)
- **trim**: (remove whitespace around)
- **swapCase**: `Lorem Ipsum` => `lOREM iPSUM`
- **capitalize**: `lorem ipsum` => `Lorem ipsum`
- **titleize**: `lorem ipsum` => `Lorem Ipsum`
- **camelize**: `lorem ipsum factory_bean` => `loremIpsumFactoryBean`
- **underscored**: `Lorem Ipsum` => `lorem_ipsum`
- **dasherize**: `Lorem Ipsum` => `Lorem Ipsum`
- **humanize**: `loremIpsum_FactoryBean` => `Lorem ipsum factory bean`
- **classify**: `Lor.em Ip sum` => `LorEmIpSum`
- **slugify**: `Lo!rem/ Ip = sum` => `lorem-ip-sum`
- **stripTags**: `Lorem <br>Ipsum` => `Lorem Ipsum`
- **escapeHTML**: `<b>Lorem Ipsum</b>` => `&lt;b&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/b&gt;`
- **unescapeHTML**: `&lt;b&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/b&gt;` => `<b>Lorem Ipsum</b>`

Some additional built-ins:

- **double**: `Lorem` => `LoremLorem`


## TODO

- make sure that the replaced text is properly selected (not the old range)


## Open Questions

I am currently thinking about these topics 
and would appreciate input from the community: 

- how to organize the different commands internally
- how to organize different command (groups) wrt menus, etc?
    - group it all in `Packages > Transform > â€¦` and let the user configure which further menus to add where?
- does a base package extensible by plugins (ala `autocomplete-plus`) make sense?
